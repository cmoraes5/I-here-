Hello, welcome to "I'm here!", an app build for organize events

I'here! was made with React-Native and Expo, he was an project developed 
along first module of the course that i studying.

Ending the fisrt module, i had the app almost ready, but i wanted to
practice React-Native and update my app, so i added more functionatiles and features,
like, react navigation by stack, cards for divide the events and 
possibility to change event name and event date/description.
